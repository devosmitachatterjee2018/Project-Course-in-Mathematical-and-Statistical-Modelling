- Propose a state transition model for describing the traffic scenarios.
- Describe the surrounding traffic objects in the model by occupation grids. The grids are translated into binary matrices where 1 denotes the occupation of nearby traffic object. Also attributes such as the vehicleâ€™s speed and angular movement are used.
- Evaluate the model by analysing sequences of states computed from real traffic data provided by Viscando.
- Use clustering method to distinguish different scenarios represented by the model.
